# UnterUns
An app for a Geocaching school project.

The group project included:
- Planning out two routes
- Writing a story
- Creating riddles
- A mobile companion app

The app routes players towards the next station via hard-coded waypoints.
Once in the vicinity of the station, the app automatically switches from displaying a compass to a camera view.
The players are then meant to find a hidden box and scan an attached QR code.
Once that is done, the app lets users input the answer to a riddle or functions as an interactive riddle itself, for example via playing morse code that's to be translated by cross-referencing the sounds with the corresponding words.

Additional materials that covered other parts of this project may be uploaded at a later point in time.

The possibility to fork this into a customizable app usable for similar projects is reserved and might be executed in the future.
